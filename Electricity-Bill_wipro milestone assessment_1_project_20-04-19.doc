Project Assessment
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please carefully read the below instructions
The objective of this assessment is to check your ability to complete a project as per the provided “Project Design”.
You are expected to –
1.      Write the source code for the classes, methods and packages EXACTLY as mentioned in the “Project Design” section.
2.      Ensure that the names of the packages, classes, methods and variables EXACTLY MATCH with the names specified in the “Project Design” section.
3.      Understand the project requirements and ACCORDINGLY WRITE the code and logic in the classes and methods so as to meet all given requirements.
Creating the project and testing it –
1.      You are expected to create your project locally using eclipse (or any other IDE) on your desktop. 
2.      Once you are ready with the code, you should upload the src folder of your project in .zip format, using the “Upload Zip File” button.
IMPORTANT NOTE 1 : The extension of the zip file should be ONLY .zip (any other zip formats such as .7z  will produce unexpected results)
IMPORTANT NOTE 2 : The .zip file should contain zip of ONLY the src folder structure from your project. (If the zip file has anything other than the src folder structure, the result will be unexpected. Do not zip the entire project folder structure. Just do the zip of the src folder structure and upload it)
IMPORTANT NOTE 3 : The name of the .zip file should be <your employee number>.zip For e.g., if your emp no. is 12345, the zip file should be named 12345.zip.
3.      After uploading the zip file, you can click on “Compile & Test” button and the assessment engine will compile your source code and test it using its pre-defined test-cases.
4.      If some of the test-cases fail, you can make the fixes in your source code locally on your desktop, and again repeat the above two steps.
5.      Once you are finished with all the fixes, you can click on “Final Submission” button, which will show you the final result/score.
 
NOTE that –
6.      The assessment engine will create objects and invoke methods as per the project design, and while doing so, it will use your packages, classes and methods. If your packages, classes and methods have a name mismatch or method prototype mismatch w.r.t the expected “Project Design”, the tool will show it as an ERROR. If your packages, classes and methods match as per the names but do not perform the expected functionality, the tool will show it as a FAILURE.
7.      Unless specified in the Project Design, DO NOT use System.exit(0) anywhere in your code. Using System.exit(0) in your project code will cause the CPC test engine to exit and it will not be able to run all test-cases.

Electricity Bill Calculation
Project Objective:
Create a console based Java application that would allow an electricity board clerk to compute the electricity bill amount that needs to be paid by the customer for a given type of electricity connection
Details:
There are two types of electric connections available. One is Domestic Connection and the other one is Commercial Connection. The following are the formulas that are to be used for computation of Bill for each type.
Domestic
Unit Slabs	Tariff Rate
First 50 units	2.3
Next 50 units	4.2
Remaining units	5.5
 
Eg) If units consumed is 120, then amount payable is 435.
Commercial
Unit Slabs	Tariff Rate
First 50 units	5.2
Next 50 units	6.8
Remaining units	8.3
 
In Commercial Connection type, in addition to the bill amount there is an electricity duty that is applicable. The calculations for the electricity duty is as follows:
BillAmount	Electricity Duty
Bill Amount >= 10000	0.09
Bill Amount >=5000	0.06
Bill Amount < 5000	0.02
 
For example, if Bill Amount>10000 then
Electricity Duty=Bill Amount* 0.09
So the Final Amount Payable =Bill Amount + Electricity Duty
Eg) If units consumed is 120, then amount payable is 781.32 (i.e. 766 + 15.32)
Project Design:
A. System Design:
Name of the package	Usage
com.wipro.eb.entity	This package will contain the EB Connection related classes 
com.wipro.eb.exception	This package will contain the user defined exception classes
com.wipro.eb.main	This package will contain the MainClass that is used to test the application
com.wipro.eb.service	This package will contain the class that is used to validate the data and invoke the respective EB Connection Classes to calculate the bill amount
 



Package: com.wipro.eb.exception
Class	Method and Variables	Description
InvalidReadingException	 	A user defined exception class. Details about when this exception is given in the respective methods
 	public String toString() 	This function should return
“Incorrect Reading”
Package: com.wipro.eb.exception
Class	 	Description
InvalidConnectionException	 	A user defined exception class. Details about when this exception is given in the respective methods
 	public String toString()	This function should return
“Invalid ConnectionType”
 
Package: com.wipro.eb.entity
Class	Method and Variables	Description
Connection	 	Abstract Class
 	int previousReading;	Previous month meter reading
 	int currentReading;	Current month meter reading
 	float[] slabs;	Used to store different slab rate
 	public Connection(int currentReading, int previousReading,float slabs[])	A constructor used to initialize the member variables
 	public abstract float computeBill()	An abstract method to compute the bill for a particular month

?         If all the 3 data are valid the function should return true
 	public float calculateBillAmt(int currentReading, int previousReading, String type) 	?         This method will invoke the validate method to check whether all the 3 inputs received are valid
?         If the validate method throws InvalidReadingException, this function should handle it and return -1
?         If the validate method throws InvalidConnectionException, this function should handle it and return -2
?         If the validate method returns true this function should create appropriate Connection type object and invoke the computeBill method and return the computed billamount.
[If type is “Domestic”, then the Domestic object needs to be created If type is “Commercial”, then the Commercial object needs to be created.]
